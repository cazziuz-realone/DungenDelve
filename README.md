# DungenDelve

*A GameLit/RPGLit Series*

## About This World

Three years ago, everything changed. The first portal cracked open in Central Park, and suddenly humanity wasn't alone anymore. We call it the Awakening—that moment when ancient magic crashed into our modern world and turned ordinary people into something more.

**What You'll Find Here:**
- World-building documents covering the post-Awakening society
- Class and power system mechanics 
- Dungeon guides and portal lore
- Character development resources
- Chapter drafts and story content

## The World at a Glance

**Portals**: Doorways to pocket dimensions filled with danger and treasure  
**Classes**: Power-based roles that define your abilities and growth  
**Levels**: Real progression through combat, skill use, and achievement
