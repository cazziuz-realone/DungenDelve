# Sample Chapter: "Coffee Shop Catastrophe"

*Demonstrating DungenDelve writing style and world integration*

---

The portal opened right in the middle of my Tuesday morning coffee run.

I'm standing there at *Brew & Tell*, trying to decide if spending seven dollars on a latte is worth it when my student loan payment is due next week. The barista—some hipster kid with more piercings than a tackle box—is taking forever to steam milk. Behind me, the usual crowd of office workers checks phones and pretends they're not all dead inside.

Then reality just... cracks.

It starts as a headache. Sharp, stabbing pain right behind my eyes like someone's trying to drill through my skull with a rusty screwdriver. Half the people in line wince and grab their heads. The other half keep scrolling through Instagram because apparently interdimensional rifts aren't worth looking up from social media.

The air shimmers near the back corner, by the table where that woman always sits with her laptop, typing furiously and glaring at anyone who dares to speak above a whisper. She looks up from her screen just as the shimmer becomes a crack, and the crack becomes a hole in space about the size of a garage door.

Purple light pours out. Not pretty purple—angry purple, the kind that makes your teeth ache and your vision blur. The woman with the laptop scrambles backward, knocking over her chair. Her MacBook hits the floor with a crash that somehow sounds distant and muffled.

"Everybody out!" someone shouts. Might be me. Hard to tell over the sound of reality tearing.

The coffee shop erupts into chaos. People push toward the exit, shoving past each other with that special kind of politeness that only appears during emergencies—lots of "excuse me" and "sorry" while elbowing strangers in the ribs.

I should be running too. That's what sensible people do when interdimensional portals open in their neighborhood coffee shop. Run away fast, call the authorities, let someone else deal with the cosmic horror.

Instead, I'm counting.

Twenty-three people in the shop when this started. Hipster barista makes twenty-four. Laptop woman is twenty-five. I can see them all in my head like little dots on a map, and somehow I know exactly where everyone is in the chaos.

Sixteen people have made it outside. Five more are stuck by the pastry display because some genius decided to abandon his stroller right in the middle of the aisle. Three people are hiding behind the counter, including the barista who's probably wondering if this job pays enough to deal with otherworldly intrusions.

That leaves one person unaccounted for.

I turn toward the portal, and sure enough, there's laptop woman. She's pressed against the wall next to the tear in space, too scared to move. The purple light washes over her face, and I can see her mouth moving in what's probably prayer or cursing. Hard to tell the difference sometimes.

Something moves in the portal. Something big and dark with too many legs.

"Hey!" I shout at the frozen woman. "Move!"

She doesn't respond. Shock, probably. I've seen it before during the corporate layoffs—people just shut down when things get too weird too fast.

The creature starts to emerge. Looks like a spider the size of a golden retriever, except spiders don't usually have crystals growing out of their backs or eyes that glow like headlights. It clicks and chitches as it pulls itself through the portal, each leg ending in something that's part claw, part blade.

Laptop woman whimpers.

I should definitely be running now.

Instead, I grab the abandoned stroller and shove it toward the spider-thing. Not exactly a battle tactic they teach in self-defense class, but it's what I've got. The stroller bounces off the creature's crystal carapace with a metallic clang that would be satisfying if I wasn't probably about to die.

The spider turns toward me, all eight glowing eyes focusing with predatory intensity. Up close, I can see that the crystals on its back pulse with the same purple light as the portal. Probably not a coincidence.

"Run!" I yell at laptop woman. This time she listens, scrambling along the wall toward the exit.

The spider-thing rears up on its hind legs and makes a sound like a garbage disposal eating silverware. Several more legs emerge from the portal behind it. Great. Where there's one interdimensional spider, there's apparently a whole family reunion.

That's when the notification appears.

It just pops into existence in the corner of my vision, like a text message from the universe itself. Blue text on a translucent background, impossible to ignore:

**[AWAKENING CRITERIA MET]**  
**[EVALUATING CANDIDATE...]**  
**[CLASS UNLOCK AVAILABLE]**

I blink hard, thinking I'm hallucinating from fear or bad coffee. The message stays put. The spider-thing doesn't care about my existential crisis and lunges forward, crystal claws aimed at my face.

Time slows down. Not metaphorically—literally slows, like someone hit the universe's replay button. I can see every detail of the creature's attack, track the arc of each claw, calculate exactly where it's going to hit.

More importantly, I can see how to avoid it.

I duck left, grab a metal napkin dispenser from the nearest table, and swing it like a very expensive baseball bat. The dispenser connects with the spider's side with a satisfying crunch. The creature goes flying into the wall, crystal carapace cracking.

Another notification:

**[TACTICAL ASSESSMENT: EXCEPTIONAL]**  
**[LEADERSHIP UNDER PRESSURE: CONFIRMED]**  
**[CLASS UNLOCKED: COORDINATOR]**

A warm sensation spreads through my chest, like drinking hot chocolate after coming in from the cold. Suddenly I feel... more. Stronger, faster, smarter. Like someone just upgraded my personal operating system.

The fallen spider twitches and starts to get up. Two more emerge from the portal. Behind them, I can see what looks like an underground cavern filled with glowing purple crystals and probably a lot more spiders.

Time to test the new software.

I reach out with senses I didn't have thirty seconds ago and somehow know exactly where everyone is in a three-block radius. The other customers are safely outside. Emergency responders are two minutes away. The portal is stable but growing slowly.

Most importantly, I know exactly how to handle this situation.

"Corner them," I mutter to myself. "Force them away from the portal."

I grab a chair and hurl it at the leftmost spider. It dodges, but that's fine—I wasn't trying to hit it. I was herding it toward the front window, away from the dimensional tear.

The middle spider lunges at me. I roll behind the counter, coming up with the industrial coffee grinder. Thirty pounds of stainless steel makes an excellent blunt weapon. The spider's claws scrape across the metal surface as I swing, leaving scratches but not penetrating.

Third spider tries to flank me from the right. I kick over a display rack of travel mugs, creating a barrier of ceramic and metal. Not enough to stop it, but enough to slow it down.

Best of all, all three creatures are now between me and the portal, exactly where I want them.

"Come on," I tell them, backing toward the front door. "Follow the nice human."

They do. Spiders might be predators, but they're not particularly smart. They see prey moving away and give chase, clicking and chittering in what probably passes for excitement in spider culture.

I reach the door and shove it open. Sunlight streams in, and all three spiders stop dead. Their crystal growths dim noticeably in natural light. Interesting.

"Photosensitive," I realize. "You don't like the sun."

I prop the door open with the brass doorstop and grab the nearest thing that might work as a mirror—someone's dropped phone with a reflective case. The screen is cracked, but it still catches and reflects the morning light.

I angle the reflected sunlight toward the nearest spider. Where the light hits its crystals, they spark and smoke. The creature shrieks and scrambles backward, right into its companion.

Now they're panicking, disoriented, stumbling over each other in their haste to get away from the light. It only takes a few more seconds of creative mirror work to drive all three back through the portal.

As soon as they're through, the purple tear starts to shrink. Within minutes, it's gone completely, leaving only a scorch mark on the wall and the lingering smell of ozone.

I stand there in the destroyed coffee shop, holding a stranger's broken phone, wearing a name tag that says **[COORDINATOR - LEVEL 1]** in floating blue text that apparently only I can see.

"Well," I say to nobody in particular. "That's new."

Sirens wail in the distance. Through the front window, I can see people gathering on the sidewalk, pointing and taking pictures. Someone's already livestreaming on their phone.

Great. I'm about to become a meme.

The hipster barista emerges from behind the counter, looking shell-shocked. "Dude," he says, staring at the scorch mark where reality was recently broken. "That was, like, totally insane."

"Yeah," I agree. "Probably going to need therapy."

"Are you, like, one of those Awakened people now?"

I look at the name tag floating in my peripheral vision. **[COORDINATOR - LEVEL 1]**. Below it, a small health bar, a mana meter, and what appears to be a minimap showing the immediate area.

"Looks like it."

"Cool." He pauses, looking around at the wreckage of his workplace. "So, um, you still want that latte?"

I consider this. On one hand, I just gained magical powers and probably saved a bunch of lives. On the other hand, I still have student loans and the coffee here really is excellent.

"Make it a double shot," I tell him. "It's been a weird morning."

He nods sagely, like interdimensional spider attacks are just another Tuesday occupational hazard. "Double shot mocha with oat milk, coming right up."

As he starts the espresso machine, I check the notifications that are still blinking in the corner of my vision:

**[QUEST COMPLETED: EMERGENCY RESPONSE]**  
**[EXPERIENCE GAINED: 500 XP]**  
**[NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED: TACTICAL OVERVIEW]**  
**[GUILD RECRUITMENT OFFERS: 3 PENDING]**

Guild recruitment? Already? I haven't even figured out how to turn off the floating name tag.

Outside, a black SUV with government plates pulls up. Two people in expensive suits get out, both wearing the kind of confident expression that says they deal with impossible things for a living.

Department of Extradimensional Affairs, probably. I've seen them on the news.

One of them—a middle-aged woman with graying hair and kind eyes—approaches the coffee shop. She sees me through the window and nods politely.

"Ma'am," she says, stepping inside. "I'm Agent Sarah Chen with the DEA—Extradimensional Affairs, not the drug people. We'd like to ask you a few questions about the incident."

Agent Chen. Why does that name sound familiar?

"Are you related to Sarah Chen?" I ask. "The first Guardian?"

"She's my daughter," Agent Chen says with obvious pride. "And based on what the witnesses are telling us, you handled this situation exactly like she would have. Smart, decisive, and more concerned about protecting others than your own safety."

"I just did what seemed logical."

"That's exactly what she said after her first incident." Agent Chen pulls out a tablet and starts making notes. "Tell me, have you given any thought to what you'd like to do with your new abilities?"

I look around the destroyed coffee shop. Laptop woman's computer is still on the floor, somehow undamaged. The barista is humming while he steams milk, apparently unfazed by recent events. Outside, people are already dispersing, moving on with their lives like interdimensional intrusions are just part of the urban experience now.

Three years since the first portal opened, and this is normal. People adapt. They find ways to keep living, keep working, keep buying overpriced coffee even when reality occasionally falls apart around them.

I think about my cubicle job, my student loans, my general sense that I'm wasting my life doing meaningless work for people who don't appreciate it. Then I think about the way it felt to coordinate the evacuation, to solve the problem, to actually be useful for once.

"I honestly have no idea," I tell Agent Chen. "But I guess I'm about to find out."

She smiles. "That's the best attitude to have. Here's my card. When you're ready to start figuring things out, give me a call. The government has excellent training programs for new Awakened."

"What about the guilds?"

"They'll make their offers soon enough. But take my advice—don't sign anything until you've talked to a few different organizations. And definitely don't sign anything without reading it carefully. Guild contracts can be... complicated."

The barista clears his throat. "Double shot mocha with oat milk?"

I take the cup—somehow he managed to make perfect latte art despite the recent interdimensional crisis—and sip it carefully. Still excellent coffee.

"Thanks," I tell him. "And hey, if anyone asks, you handled the whole thing really professionally."

"Thanks, dude. Hey, if you ever need coffee before a dungeon run or whatever, I'll hook you up. Employee discount."

"I'm not an employee."

"You saved my workplace from crystal spiders. That's basically the same thing."

Agent Chen finishes her notes and closes the tablet. "We'll be in touch, Ms...?"

"Riley. Riley Martinez."

"Ms. Martinez. Welcome to the Awakened community. Try not to let it go to your head."

She leaves, and I'm alone with the barista and the scorch mark on the wall. In the distance, a cleanup crew is already arriving to deal with the aftermath. Apparently portal incidents have standardized response procedures now.

I check my phone. Three missed calls from my boss, probably wondering why I'm late for the morning meeting about "leveraging our core competencies." 

For the first time in months, I don't feel like apologizing for existing.

I finish my coffee, leave a generous tip, and walk outside into the sunlight. The floating name tag in my vision has changed:

**[COORDINATOR - LEVEL 1]**  
**[NEXT OBJECTIVE: UNKNOWN]**

Unknown sounds perfect.
