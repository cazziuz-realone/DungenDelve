# The Awakening: How Everything Changed

## The Day the World Broke Open

March 15th, 2021. Call it Black Monday, the Rupture, or just the day everything went insane—but that's when the first portal tore open in Central Park.

I wasn't there, obviously. Nobody who saw it firsthand lived to tell about it. But the security footage? That shit still gives me nightmares.

One second, joggers are doing their morning routine around the reservoir. Next second, reality just... cracks. Like someone took a baseball bat to a window, except the window was the fabric of space itself. This swirling vortex of purple light rips open, and things start crawling out.

Not nice things.

## What We Know About the Ancient Network

Turns out, portals aren't new. They're older than civilization, older than humanity probably. The ancient network—that's what the scholars call it now—has been dormant for thousands of years. Stone circles, pyramid complexes, those weird megalith sites nobody could explain? All of them were portal anchors.

Something woke the network up again. Maybe it was climate change, maybe it was too many nuclear tests, or maybe we just hit some cosmic timer nobody knew about. Point is, the magic came back, and it brought friends.

Bad friends.

## The First Wave Crisis

Those initial six months were pure chaos. Portals opened randomly across the globe—Central Park, the Tower of London, Machu Picchu, Stonehenge. Creatures poured out that belonged in nightmares, not National Geographic.

Governments tried everything. Military strikes, containment protocols, even a few nuclear options that got classified so hard we'll never know what really happened. Nothing worked. Conventional weapons just bounced off most of the high-level creatures.

That's when the first Awakened appeared.

## Humanity's Response: The Awakened

Sarah Chen was probably the first, though nobody kept good records during the madness. Security guard at a mall in Portland when a portal cracked open in the food court. Instead of running like any sane person, she grabbed a fire axe and charged a pack of shadow wolves.

She shouldn't have survived. Those things were shredding SWAT teams.

But something happened when she made that choice—when she decided to fight instead of flee. The system activated. Her first notification popped up right there in the middle of combat: **[Class Unlocked: Guardian]**.

Within hours, she was level 12 and single-handedly holding the portal until military backup arrived.

## The System Emerges

Nobody knows where the system comes from. Best guess? It's part of the same ancient network that powers the portals. Some kind of magical infrastructure that recognizes human potential and turns it into measurable power.

The system doesn't care about your background, education, or bank account. It cares about one thing: what you do when the chips are down. Face danger, make hard choices, push your limits—that's how you unlock a class.

Not everyone can do it. Studies suggest maybe 30% of the population has the psychological makeup for Awakening. The rest stay baseline human, which honestly might be the smarter choice.

## Three Years Later: The New Normal

So here we are. Portals are stable now, appearing in predictable patterns tied to population density and magical saturation. We've got international treaties governing dungeon access rights. The UN has a Department of Extradimensional Affairs.

Cities reorganized around portal zones. New York has seven active portals within city limits. London has twelve. Tokyo's sitting on eighteen, which explains why their Awakened population is through the roof.

Regular people go to work, pay taxes, worry about mortgages. Awakened people delve dungeons, fight monsters, and occasionally save the world. It's weird, but it works.

Mostly.

## The Big Questions

We still don't know why the network reactivated. Ancient texts hint at cyclical events, magical tides that ebb and flow over millennia. If that's true, we might be looking at decades or centuries of portal activity.

Or it could all shut down tomorrow. Nobody knows.

What we do know is that the portals aren't random tourist attractions. They're connected to something bigger—a vast network of pocket dimensions that might span galaxies. Each dungeon is a node in that network, and we're just starting to map the connections.

Some scholars think the dungeons are testing us. Others believe they're farming us, growing human potential for some unknown purpose. A few crazy theories suggest we're being prepared for something worse that's coming.

Me? I think we're all overthinking it. The portals are here, the system works, and people are getting stronger. Whether that's good or bad probably depends on what we do with the power.

So far, the track record's been mixed.
