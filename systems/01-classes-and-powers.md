# Classes and Powers: How the System Works

## Class Awakening: It's Not What You Expect

Forget everything you think you know about RPG class selection. You don't get to scroll through a menu and pick "Wizard" because it sounds cool. The system chooses you based on who you are when everything goes wrong.

Class unlocks happen during moments of extreme stress, danger, or moral choice. The system reads your instincts, your decisions, your core personality traits—and gives you powers that match.

Want to be a Paladin? Better hope you're the type of person who throws yourself between innocent people and danger. Dreaming of Rogue abilities? The system needs to see you thinking tactically, using stealth and cunning to overcome superior force.

You can't fake it. The system knows.

## The Big Five: Primary Class Categories

### **Guardians** (Tank Classes)
**Unlock Triggers:** Protecting others, standing your ground, refusing to retreat  
**Core Mechanics:** High HP, damage reduction, threat generation  
**Variants:** Paladin, Knight, Berserker, Monk, Warden

*Sarah Chen was the first Guardian. Fire axe, shadow wolves, zero backup. She stood in that mall food court for six hours holding the portal while civilians evacuated. Level 1 to 15 in a single day.*

Guardians don't just take damage—they redirect it, absorb it, turn it into fuel for their abilities. High-level Guardians can literally stand in front of artillery strikes and walk away.

**Popular Builds:**
- **Aegis Paladin:** Ultimate damage mitigation, group buffs, healing abilities
- **Rage Berserker:** Converts incoming damage to attack power, AOE intimidation
- **Mountain Monk:** Defensive stances, chi-based abilities, crowd control

### **Strikers** (DPS Classes)
**Unlock Triggers:** Decisive action, overwhelming force, elimination of threats  
**Core Mechanics:** High damage output, precision targeting, burst capabilities  
**Variants:** Warrior, Assassin, Ranger, Elementalist, Gunslinger

Strikers solve problems by hitting them very hard. Simple, effective, occasionally messy.

*Marcus "Tank" Rodriguez unlocked Gunslinger during the Vegas Portal Crisis. SWAT background, but the system gave him abilities that turned his service pistol into something that could punch through armored trolls.*

**Popular Builds:**
- **Blademaster Warrior:** Weapon mastery, combo attacks, armor penetration
- **Shadow Assassin:** Stealth, critical strikes, poison abilities
- **Storm Elementalist:** Area damage, elemental combinations, environmental control

### **Supporters** (Utility Classes)
**Unlock Triggers:** Helping others succeed, problem-solving, strategic thinking  
**Core Mechanics:** Buffs, debuffs, crowd control, resource management  
**Variants:** Healer, Enchanter, Bard, Tactician, Summoner

Don't let the name fool you. Supporters aren't sidekicks—they're force multipliers. A good Support can turn a struggling team into an unstoppable machine.

**Popular Builds:**
- **Life Cleric:** Healing, resurrection, status removal, group endurance
- **Battle Tactician:** Command abilities, formation bonuses, predictive analysis
- **Chaos Summoner:** Creature summoning, minion control, swarm tactics

### **Specialists** (Hybrid Classes)
**Unlock Triggers:** Unique approaches, unconventional solutions, niche expertise  
**Core Mechanics:** Specialized abilities, environmental interaction, crafting integration  
**Variants:** Crafter, Scout, Investigator, Pilot, Technomancer

Specialists break the traditional role boundaries. They're the classes that make you go "wait, you can do WHAT?"

*Elena Vasquez unlocked Technomancer during the Moscow Portal Event. Computer science PhD, but when she jury-rigged a feedback loop that crashed a portal temporarily, the system decided she was something new.*

**Popular Builds:**
- **Artifice Crafter:** Magical item creation, equipment modification, resource transmutation
- **Void Scout:** Dimensional travel, reconnaissance, portal manipulation
- **Network Technomancer:** System interface, digital-magic hybrid abilities, data manipulation

### **Evolved** (Advanced Classes)
**Unlock Triggers:** Transcendent moments, class fusion, extreme specialization  
**Core Mechanics:** Unique abilities, reality manipulation, class-breaking powers  
**Variants:** Archon, Lich, Avatar, Void Walker, System Admin

Evolved classes are theoretical for most people. You need to hit level 50+ in a base class and then have some kind of paradigm-shifting experience. There are maybe twelve confirmed Evolved worldwide.

*We don't talk about the guy who became a Lich. That situation is still classified.*

## Leveling Mechanics: How You Actually Get Stronger

### **Experience Sources**
**Combat:** Fighting things stronger than you. The bigger the level gap, the more XP.  
**Discovery:** First time exploring new areas, finding unique resources, solving puzzles.  
**Achievement:** Completing major goals, protecting others, overcoming personal limitations.  
**Skill Use:** Practicing class abilities, pushing power limits, creative application.  
**Social:** Leadership, teamwork, teaching others, building organizations.

The system rewards growth, not grinding. Killing the same goblin type 500 times gives diminishing returns fast.

### **Advancement Barriers**
**Level 10:** First major threshold. Requires completing a solo challenge appropriate to your class.  
**Level 20:** Team leadership test. You have to successfully guide others through significant danger.  
**Level 30:** Specialization choice. Pick your advanced build path and prove mastery.  
**Level 40:** Community impact requirement. Your actions must benefit society somehow.  
**Level 50+:** Unknown requirements. The few people at this level aren't sharing details.

### **Stat Growth**
Every level gives you:
- +2 to your primary stat (Strength for Warriors, Intelligence for Mages, etc.)
- +1 to a secondary stat of choice
- New ability unlocks every 5 levels
- Passive improvements to existing abilities
- Small increases to HP, mana, and stamina

Max human baseline stats are around 20. Level 30 Awakened routinely hit 60+ in their primary stats. The math gets ridiculous fast.

## Abilities and Skills: What You Can Actually Do

### **Active Abilities**
These are your "spells"—deliberate powers that cost mana or stamina and have specific effects.

**Examples:**
- **Guardian's Challenge** (Paladin): Forces nearby enemies to attack you instead of allies
- **Shadow Step** (Assassin): Short-range teleportation with stealth bonus
- **Healing Touch** (Cleric): Direct HP restoration with cleansing effects
- **Weapon Forge** (Crafter): Temporarily create magical weapons from available materials

### **Passive Abilities** 
Always-on improvements that don't require activation.

**Examples:**
- **Damage Reduction** (Guardian): Flat reduction to all incoming damage
- **Critical Eye** (Striker): Increased chance to hit weak points for extra damage
- **Mana Efficiency** (Support): Reduced costs for all magical abilities
- **System Interface** (Specialist): Enhanced interaction with dungeon systems and terminals

### **Ultimate Abilities**
High-level powers with long cooldowns and dramatic effects. Usually unlocked at level 25+.

**Examples:**
- **Fortress** (Guardian): Become immovable and immune to damage for 30 seconds
- **World Slash** (Striker): Single attack that ignores armor and distance
- **Mass Resurrection** (Support): Bring back multiple fallen allies
- **Reality Hack** (Specialist): Temporarily modify local physics or system rules

## Multiclassing and Class Evolution

Most people stick with their initial class—it's safer, more predictable, easier to build teams around. But the system allows branching under specific circumstances.

### **Dual Classing**
Unlock a second class by demonstrating aptitude outside your primary role. Splits your experience gain but gives access to diverse abilities.

*Common combinations:*
- **Guardian/Healer:** Ultimate tank support
- **Striker/Scout:** Hit-and-run specialist  
- **Support/Crafter:** Magical item creator

### **Prestige Classes**
Advanced specializations that require specific achievements or story developments.

*Examples:*
- **Dragon Knight:** Guardian who defeats an actual dragon
- **Portal Walker:** Scout who survives solo exploration of deep dungeons
- **Guild Master:** Support who successfully leads organizations of 100+ Awakened

### **Class Fusion**
Extremely rare. Two compatible classes merge into something entirely new. Only happens during moments of extreme personal growth or crisis.

*Known fusions:*
- **Spell Sword:** Warrior + Mage fusion
- **Death Knight:** Guardian + Necromancer fusion (yes, that's as bad as it sounds)
- **Void Saint:** Healer + [CLASSIFIED] fusion

## Power Scaling and Balance Issues

The system tries to maintain some semblance of balance, but high-level Awakened are basically walking natural disasters.

Level 30+ characters can:
- Run faster than cars
- Punch through steel doors
- Survive falls from aircraft
- Go days without sleep or food
- Regenerate from injuries that would kill baseline humans

Level 40+ is where things get weird:
- Limited flight or teleportation
- Area-effect abilities that level city blocks
- Resistance to conventional weapons
- Ability to survive in hostile environments
- Perception that borders on precognition

Level 50+ is theoretical territory. The few confirmed cases are closely monitored by international agencies.

## The Dark Side: Power Corruption and System Abuse

Not everyone handles getting superpowers well. The system doesn't make moral judgments—it just amplifies what's already there.

**Common Problems:**
- **Power addiction:** Chasing levels at the expense of everything else
- **Superiority complex:** Treating baseline humans as inferior
- **Risk escalation:** Taking increasingly dangerous chances for advancement
- **Social isolation:** Difficulty relating to non-Awakened friends and family

**Serious Issues:**
- **Rogue Awakened:** Using powers for crime or personal gain
- **Cult formation:** High-level Awakened gathering followers
- **International incidents:** Powerful individuals ignoring national boundaries
- **System exploitation:** Finding loopholes or glitches for unfair advantages

The UN's Department of Extradimensional Affairs exists primarily to handle these situations. They have their own team of high-level Awakened, extensive legal frameworks, and some very scary contingency plans.

## Getting Started: Advice for New Awakened

**Don't try to force an Awakening.** The system sees through fake heroics and manufactured crises. Focus on becoming the kind of person who would deserve the class you want.

**Train your mind, not just your body.** The system reads psychology as much as physical capability. Mental preparation matters.

**Find a mentor.** Experienced Awakened can teach you things the system notifications won't explain.

**Join a guild early.** Solo players have high casualty rates. Team training saves lives.

**Respect baseline humans.** You were one of them a few years ago. Don't forget where you came from.

And remember—getting powers is the easy part. Figuring out what to do with them is where it gets complicated.
