# Technical Appendices: System Balance and Mechanics

*Mathematical frameworks and balance considerations for DungenDelve systems*

## Character Progression Mathematics

### **Level-Based Power Scaling**

**Stat Progression Formula:**
- Primary Stat: Base 10 + (Level × 2) + Class Bonus
- Secondary Stats: Base 10 + Level + Chosen Bonuses
- Tertiary Stats: Base 10 + (Level ÷ 2, rounded down)

**Example Progression (Level 20 Guardian):**
- Strength (Primary): 10 + 40 + 5 (class) = 55
- Constitution (Secondary): 10 + 20 + 10 (chosen) = 40
- Intelligence (Tertiary): 10 + 10 = 20

**Power Level Scaling:**
- **Levels 1-10:** Learning fundamentals, 2x baseline human capability
- **Levels 11-20:** Professional competence, 5x baseline human capability
- **Levels 21-30:** Expert mastery, 10x baseline human capability
- **Levels 31-40:** Legendary ability, 20x baseline human capability
- **Levels 41-50:** Reality-bending power, 50x baseline human capability
- **Levels 51+:** Theoretical/mythical, 100x+ baseline human capability

### **Experience Point Economy**

**XP Sources and Values:**
- **Combat (appropriate level):** 100-500 XP per encounter
- **Combat (higher level):** Up to 1000 XP for significant challenge
- **Skill Use (creative):** 50-200 XP per significant application
- **Achievement (personal):** 200-1000 XP for breakthrough moments
- **Achievement (community):** 500-2000 XP for helping others
- **Discovery:** 100-500 XP for new information or locations

**Level Requirements:**
- **Levels 1-5:** 1000 XP per level (learning curve)
- **Levels 6-15:** 2000 XP per level (skill development)
- **Levels 16-25:** 5000 XP per level (mastery phase)
- **Levels 26-35:** 10,000 XP per level (expertise)
- **Levels 36-45:** 20,000 XP per level (legendary status)
- **Levels 46-50:** 50,000 XP per level (mythical achievement)

**Diminishing Returns:**
Repeating the same activity provides reduced XP:
- First time: 100% value
- 2-5 times: 75% value
- 6-10 times: 50% value
- 11+ times: 25% value

## Class Balance Framework

### **Role Distribution Theory**

**Primary Roles (approximately equal population):**
- **Guardians:** 28% of Awakened (natural protectors and leaders)
- **Strikers:** 32% of Awakened (action-oriented problem solvers)
- **Supporters:** 25% of Awakened (collaborative and service-minded)
- **Specialists:** 15% of Awakened (unique perspectives and approaches)

**Power Budget Allocation:**
Each class gets equivalent total power distributed differently:
- **Guardians:** High durability, moderate damage, group protection
- **Strikers:** High damage, moderate durability, individual focus
- **Supporters:** Moderate personal power, high force multiplication
- **Specialists:** Variable power, unique capabilities, niche excellence

### **Ability Power Levels**

**Damage Scaling (per level):**
- **Basic Attacks:** Character level × 5 damage
- **Active Abilities:** Character level × 10 damage (with resource cost)
- **Ultimate Abilities:** Character level × 25 damage (major cooldown)

**Defensive Scaling:**
- **Health Points:** 50 + (Level × 20) + Constitution modifier
- **Damage Reduction:** 5% + (Level × 1%) + Class bonuses
- **Resistance Values:** 10% + (Level × 0.5%) per relevant stat

**Resource Pools:**
- **Mana:** 20 + (Level × 10) + Intelligence modifier
- **Stamina:** 30 + (Level × 5) + Constitution modifier
- **Special Resources:** Class-specific formulas

### **Encounter Design Mathematics**

**Creature Challenge Rating:**
- **Trivial:** CR = Party Level - 3
- **Easy:** CR = Party Level - 1
- **Moderate:** CR = Party Level
- **Hard:** CR = Party Level + 2
- **Deadly:** CR = Party Level + 4

**Action Economy Balance:**
- Single powerful opponent needs 2-3 actions per round vs. 4-6 party members
- Multiple weaker opponents: Total CR spread across group
- Environmental hazards count as 0.5 CR worth of opposition

## Portal and Dungeon Mechanics

### **Portal Manifestation Probability**

**Base Manifestation Rate:**
- Population Density Factor: (Population ÷ 10,000) × Base Rate
- Ley Line Intersection: +50% probability
- Historical Significance: +25% probability
- Emotional Resonance Events: +75% probability temporary
- Previous Portal Proximity: -25% probability (interference)

**Global Portal Cap Theory:**
- Maximum sustainable portals ≈ 10,000 globally
- Current count (2025): ~3,847 active portals
- New manifestations balanced by occasional closures
- Deep network intelligence manages distribution

### **Dungeon Scaling Formulas**

**Creature Population:**
- **Standard Encounters:** 3-5 creatures per 1000 square feet
- **Boss Encounters:** 1 major creature per 2000 square feet
- **Environmental Hazards:** 1-2 per 500 square feet in dangerous areas

**Loot Distribution:**
- **Common Items:** 60% of drops
- **Uncommon Items:** 25% of drops
- **Rare Items:** 12% of drops
- **Very Rare Items:** 2.5% of drops
- **Legendary Items:** 0.5% of drops

**Resource Regeneration:**
- Standard dungeons: Full respawn every 24-48 hours
- Puzzle dungeons: Reset when all parties exit
- Survival dungeons: Continuous regeneration
- Raid dungeons: Weekly reset cycle
- Fractal dungeons: Variable/unpredictable

## Economic Balance Models

### **Equipment Pricing Formula**

**Base Item Cost:**
- **Mundane Equipment:** Standard real-world pricing
- **Magical Enhancement:** Base Cost × (1 + Enhancement Level²)
- **Rarity Multiplier:** Common ×1, Uncommon ×3, Rare ×10, Very Rare ×30, Legendary ×100

**Example Calculations:**
- Basic Sword ($200) + Minor Enhancement (+1) = $200 × (1 + 1²) = $400
- Rare Sword ($200 × 10) + Major Enhancement (+3) = $2000 × (1 + 3²) = $20,000

**Income Scaling:**
- **Baseline Human Average:** $45,000/year (adjusted for portal economy)
- **New Awakened (Levels 1-10):** $60,000-120,000/year
- **Professional Delvers (Levels 11-25):** $120,000-300,000/year
- **Expert Level (Levels 26-35):** $300,000-750,000/year
- **Legendary (Levels 36+):** $750,000+ or beyond monetary systems

### **Portal Resource Economy**

**Resource Generation Rates:**
- **Copper Mine (Novice):** 500-1000 units/day when actively cleared
- **Crystal Caves (Adept):** 200-400 units/day of higher-value materials
- **Deep Excavations (Expert+):** 50-100 units/day of rare materials

**Market Value Fluctuations:**
- Portal materials compete with traditional sources
- Scarcity drives prices higher than conventional alternatives
- Bulk processing requires specialized magical technology
- International trade affected by portal access treaties

## Social Integration Mathematics
