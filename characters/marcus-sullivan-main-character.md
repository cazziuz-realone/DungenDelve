## Pre-Awakening Background

His father, Tom Sullivan, was a construction foreman who lost his job when magical construction techniques made traditional building obsolete. His mother, Linda, works as a school administrator helping integrate Awakened students into public education.

**Education:** Associates degree in Computer Science from Portland Community College. Was working toward bachelor's degree before financial pressures forced him to drop out.

**Employment:** Night shift security guard at a warehouse complex. Chose night work because it paid better and he preferred being alone. Good with computers, handled basic IT troubleshooting for his employer.

## The Awakening Event

### **The Incident - June 8, 2024, 2:30 AM**

Marcus was doing his usual patrol rounds at the warehouse when a portal manifested in the loading dock area. Three **Shadow Wolves** (Level 8-10 creatures) emerged before the Portal Authority could respond.

Instead of calling for help and evacuating (standard protocol), Marcus made a split-second decision that revealed his core nature: *he couldn't let these things escape into the residential area six blocks away.*

Using a fire axe from the emergency kit, Marcus fought all three wolves alone. During the fight, as he killed the first wolf, something unprecedented happened:

**[SYSTEM ANOMALY DETECTED]**  
**[UNIQUE ABILITY MANIFESTED]**  
**[ESSENCE ABSORPTION: SHADOW WOLF]**  
**[CLASS DESIGNATION: ERROR - UNKNOWN TYPE]**

Marcus absorbed the wolf's essence and gained its abilities: enhanced night vision, silent movement, and pack hunting instincts. This power boost let him kill the remaining wolves, absorbing their abilities as well.

### **Awakening Trigger Analysis**
The System recognized Marcus's core traits:
- **Survival Instinct:** Will do whatever it takes to protect himself and others
- **Adaptive Nature:** Learns from every experience and incorporates new knowledge
- **Predatory Focus:** Can switch from observer to hunter when necessary
- **Strategic Mind:** Understands that power is only useful if you can keep it

## Unique Ability: Essence Absorption

### **How It Works**
When Marcus kills a creature (monster, beast, or if absolutely necessary, human), he can choose to absorb its "essence"—the fundamental qualities that made it what it was.

**Absorption Process:**
1. Must make physical contact with target within 30 seconds of death
2. Conscious choice required—not automatic
3. Takes 10-15 seconds of concentration during absorption
4. Temporarily vulnerable during the process

**What He Gains:**
- **Physical Traits:** Enhanced senses, natural weapons (claws, improved reflexes)
- **Magical Abilities:** Elemental resistance, spell-like abilities
- **Instincts:** Combat techniques, survival knowledge, behavioral patterns
- **Resistances:** Immunity to toxins, environmental adaptations

**Limitations:**
- **Capacity Limit:** Can only maintain essences from ~12-15 creatures simultaneously
- **Compatibility:** Some essences conflict with each other or with human biology
- **Degradation:** Unused essences fade over time (6-12 months)
- **Mental Load:** Each essence carries fragmentary memories and instincts
- **Physical Strain:** Body adapts slowly; rapid absorption causes pain and exhaustion

### **Current Absorbed Essences** (as of story start)
1. **Shadow Wolf Pack** (3x) - Stealth, night vision, pack coordination
2. **Copper Sprite** (2x) - Electrical resistance, metal detection
3. **Crystal Spider** - Wall climbing, vibration sense
4. **Flame Salamander** - Heat resistance, minor fire generation
5. **Echo Bat** - Echolocation, enhanced hearing
6. **Stone Beetle** - Natural armor plating, burrowing ability

### **Hidden Reality**

**Moral Considerations:**
