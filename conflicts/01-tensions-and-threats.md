# Conflicts and Tensions in the Portal Age

## The Guild Wars: Competition Gone Wrong

Call them business disputes if you want to be polite. The rest of us know them as the Guild Wars—three years of increasingly aggressive competition between major delving organizations that occasionally spilled over into actual violence.

It started simple enough. Multiple guilds wanted exclusive access to the same high-value portals. Standard corporate rivalry, lawsuits, lobbying campaigns. Then the *Shadowmere* guild tried to sabotage *Iron Brotherhood* equipment during a raid dungeon attempt.

Four people died.

After that, the gloves came off. Guild recruitment became aggressive headhunting. Training grounds got mysteriously sabotaged. High-level delvers started disappearing during solo expeditions.

The Peak Wars ended when the *Azure Company* and *Northwind Collective* had an actual battle outside a Master-level portal in the Swiss Alps. Fifty Awakened on each side, full combat, explosions visible from three countries away.

The UN's Department of Extradimensional Affairs stepped in hard after that. New regulations, mandatory mediation, severe penalties for inter-guild violence. The major guilds signed the Zurich Accords in 2024.

But tensions still exist. They're just more... subtle now.

### **Current Major Guilds**

**Iron Brotherhood** (US-based, international operations)  
- Military-style hierarchy, former special forces leadership
- Specializes in high-risk rescue operations and military contracts
- 2,500+ active members, reputation for discipline and effectiveness
- Rumored to have government backing for "special projects"

**Azure Company** (EU-based, corporate structure)  
- Business-focused approach, publicly traded on three stock exchanges
- Emphasizes safety protocols and consistent profit margins
- 3,000+ active members, excellent insurance and benefits
- Accused of prioritizing PR over actual delving competence

**Eastern Wind Collective** (Asia-Pacific federation)  
- Loose confederation of smaller regional guilds
- Traditional honor codes mixed with cutting-edge technology
- 4,000+ combined membership, highly diverse specializations
- Internal politics make decision-making slow but consensus strong

**Free Companies** (Independent contractors)  
- Thousands of small teams and solo operators
- No central organization, coordinate through online platforms
- Variable quality but often innovative approaches
- Suffer from lack of resources and institutional support

## Rogue Awakened: When Power Corrupts

Not everyone handles superpowers responsibly. Shocking, I know.

The problem isn't just crime—though Awakened criminals are definitely a headache for law enforcement. The real issue is people who decide that having magic makes them special enough to ignore laws, borders, and basic human decency.

### **Categories of Rogue Behavior**

**Petty Criminals:** Using abilities for theft, fraud, or intimidation  
*Example: Marcus "Fingers" Chen, level 12 Rogue who could phase through walls. Robbed seventeen banks before getting caught by a Guild trap team.*

**Superiority Complex:** Treating baseline humans as inferior species  
*Example: The "Pure Blood" movement in Eastern Europe, advocating for Awakened political dominance. Three attempted coups before international intervention.*

**Warlords:** Accumulating power through force and establishing personal kingdoms  
*Example: "General" Hassan in North Africa, level 35 Warlord with 200+ followers. Still at large despite multiple international task force attempts.*

**Cult Leaders:** Using charisma and power to gather devoted followers  
*Example: The "Children of the System" in California. Mass suicide event when leader claimed he could "ascend" followers to evolved status. 89 dead.*

**Ideological Extremists:** Attempting to remake society according to personal vision  
*Example: [CLASSIFIED—see Department of Extradimensional Affairs Report XD-4471]*

### **The Containment Problem**

Arresting someone who can punch through steel doors, move faster than cars, and shrug off small arms fire requires specialized tactics.

Most countries maintain "Response Teams"—units of high-level Awakened specifically trained for law enforcement against rogue individuals. It's dangerous work with high turnover.

**Containment Methods:**
- **Suppression Collars:** Magical devices that interfere with system access
- **Power Drain Cells:** Prison facilities that slowly reduce Awakened abilities
- **Pharmaceutical Intervention:** Drugs that block neural pathways used by the system
- **Exile Protocols:** Permanent banishment to monitored pocket dimensions
- **Termination Orders:** When all else fails (classified success rates)

## International Tensions and Portal Politics

### **Resource Inequality**
Some countries won the portal lottery. Others didn't. Guess how that's working out.

**Portal-Rich Nations:**
- **Japan:** 47 active portals, highest Awakened per capita rate
- **United Kingdom:** 31 portals, strong guild infrastructure
- **Germany:** 28 portals, excellent research facilities
- **South Korea:** 23 portals, integration with existing tech industry

**Portal-Poor Regions:**
- **Most of Africa:** 12 total portals across entire continent
- **Central Asia:** 8 portals in massive geographical area
- **Northern Canada:** 3 portals, all in remote locations
- **Antarctica:** 1 portal (international research station)

The Portal Access Treaties of 2023 tried to address this disparity through resource sharing agreements. Portal-rich nations provide training and equipment to portal-poor regions in exchange for access to their larger baseline populations for recruitment.

It works better on paper than in practice.

### **The Chinese Question**
China's approach to portal management has... concerned... other nations.

Strict state control of all Awakened individuals. Mandatory military service. Portal access limited to government-approved teams. International delving partnerships heavily restricted.

Also the most efficient portal exploitation rate globally, lowest Awakened crime statistics, and fastest technological advancement in portal-related fields.

Other countries publicly criticize Chinese methods while privately wondering if they're doing something right.

### **The Brazilian Incident**
In 2024, a Master-level portal in the Amazon spawned creatures that escaped containment and established a permanent foothold in the rainforest. Three months later, the "infected zone" covered 200 square kilometers.

Brazil requested international assistance. The US, EU, and UN all sent aid. China sent observers. Russia sent nothing but criticism.

The cleanup operation required 800 international Awakened and resulted in 23 deaths. The infected zone was successfully contained, but tensions over responsibility, command authority, and resource allocation nearly triggered a diplomatic crisis.

Now there's a permanent international monitoring station in the Amazon. Nobody's entirely sure what they're monitoring for.

## The Baseline Human Rights Movement

Seventy percent of humanity can't access the primary economic engine of the new world. This has created... social friction.

### **Legitimate Concerns**
- Economic displacement as traditional industries become obsolete
- Political representation when Awakened can simply ignore baseline government
- Healthcare inequality (magical healing vs. traditional medicine)
- Educational opportunity gaps
- Social stratification based on innate magical potential

### **Extremist Responses**
**The Pure Human Alliance:** Anti-Awakened terrorist organization  
*Methods: Bombing Guild facilities, assassinating prominent Awakened, attempting to destroy portals*

**Genetic Purists:** Believe Awakening represents human "contamination"  
*Methods: Political lobbying, scientific research into "cures," reproductive controls*

**Equality Radicals:** Demand forced redistribution of Awakened benefits  
*Methods: Civil disobedience, occupation of portal sites, sabotage of delving operations*

Most baseline humans don't support extremist groups, but sympathy for their underlying concerns is widespread. Politicians ignore this at their peril.

## The Deep Dungeon Mysteries

Not all threats come from human conflicts. The portal network itself holds dangers we're just beginning to understand.

### **The Depth Phenomenon**
Some portals have "layers"—deeper levels accessible only after clearing previous sections. The pattern seems to be that each layer increases in both difficulty and strangeness.

Layer 1: Standard dungeon experiences  
Layer 2: Enhanced creatures, environmental hazards  
Layer 3: Reality distortions, temporal anomalies  
Layer 4: [DATA EXPUNGED]
Layer 5+: No confirmed successful exploration

### **The Watchers**
Multiple independent teams report encounters with entities that don't fit standard creature categories. Intelligent beings that observe but don't interact. Some appear to be taking notes.

Attempts at communication have yielded minimal results. The entities seem more interested in studying human behavior than engaging in dialogue.

This has led to uncomfortable questions about the true purpose of the portal network.

### **System Glitches**
Occasionally, the system malfunctions in ways that suggest it's not as omniscient as it appears.

**Documented Anomalies:**
- Awakened receiving abilities from wrong class types
- Experience point calculations producing impossible results
- Status effects that don't correspond to any known abilities
- Interface text appearing in unknown languages
- Level requirements suddenly changing for existing portals

Most anomalies resolve themselves within hours. Some don't.

The few Awakened who've experienced persistent system glitches report feeling "watched" by the interface itself. Several have requested psychological evaluation.

## Technological Disruption and Adaptation

The relationship between portal technology and conventional science creates ongoing tension between traditional industries and emerging magical alternatives.

### **Energy Sector Crisis**
Magical power sources from dungeons are cleaner, more efficient, and potentially unlimited. Coal, oil, and nuclear power lobbies have responded with:
- Legal challenges to magical energy licensing
- Funding anti-portal research
- Political pressure for "energy security" based on conventional sources
- Industrial sabotage of magical infrastructure

Several "accidents" at magical power facilities have been linked to conventional energy companies.

### **Medical Industry Upheaval**
Healing magic makes many traditional medical procedures obsolete. A level 20 Cleric can cure cancer, regrow limbs, and eliminate genetic disorders.

This has created enormous ethical and economic problems:
- Should magical healing be covered by insurance?
- What happens to medical professionals whose expertise becomes irrelevant?
- How do you regulate treatment methods that work through "magic"?
- Can pharmaceutical companies patent magical healing techniques?

The medical establishment has split between those embracing magical integration and those fighting to preserve traditional approaches.

### **Military Implications**
High-level Awakened are living weapons that make conventional military hardware look primitive. This has forced complete strategic reorganization:

**New Military Doctrines:**
- Awakened-only special forces units
- Combined arms tactics integrating magic and technology
- Portal-based rapid deployment strategies
- Magical countermeasures against enemy Awakened

**Arms Race Concerns:**
- Nations competing to recruit the highest-level Awakened
- Development of anti-magic weapons and defenses
- Portal network as potential attack vector
- Escalation scenarios involving Evolved-class individuals

The traditional balance of power means nothing when a single individual can level city blocks.

## Looking Ahead: Emerging Threats

### **The Network Problem**
Every portal connects to the same vast interdimensional network. We've explored maybe 0.1% of it. Statistical analysis suggests the portions we've accessed are specifically designed for human-level challenges.

Something created this network. Something that considers human civilization interesting enough to provide us with training grounds.

The question is: training for what?

### **The Level Cap Question**
The highest confirmed human level is 52. But NPC creatures in deep dungeons suggest the system supports much higher levels. Some theoretical models indicate no upper limit.

What happens when humans start reaching levels 100+? 200+? At what point do we stop being recognizably human?

### **The Cascade Scenario**
Worst-case analysis suggests that sufficient disruption to the portal network could cause cascading failures across the entire system. Best case: all portals shut down permanently. Worst case: uncontrolled portal manifestation across the globe.

Several nations are believed to have contingency plans for deliberately triggering such a cascade if they determine the portal system represents an existential threat.

Nobody knows what would actually happen if they tried.

*"The portals gave us power, but power without wisdom is just another way to destroy ourselves faster."*

Three years in, we're still figuring out what we've gotten ourselves into. The conflicts we're dealing with now might look trivial compared to what's coming.

Or maybe we'll luck out and the universe will let us keep the cool magic powers without any horrible consequences.

I'm not betting on it.
