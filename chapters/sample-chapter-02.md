# Sample Chapter: "Guild Recruitment Hell"

*Continuing Riley's story - demonstrating guild politics and character development*

---

Three days after the coffee shop incident, my apartment looks like a recruiting fair exploded.

Stacks of glossy brochures cover every flat surface. "Iron Brotherhood: Forged in Fire, Tempered by Honor." "Azure Company: Your Professional Path to Excellence." "Eastern Wind Collective: Traditional Values, Modern Solutions." Even some I've never heard of—"Crimson Tide Raiders," "The Lighthouse Guild," "Dungeon Delvers United Local 847."

Apparently word travels fast in the Awakened community.

I'm sitting on my couch in yesterday's pajamas, trying to make sense of a contract from something called "Elite Dynamics Solutions" when my doorbell rings for the fourth time today.

"Go away!" I shout. "I'm not interested in whatever you're selling!"

"Ms. Martinez?" The voice is female, professional, with just a hint of amusement. "I'm not selling anything. I'm Jennifer Walsh, baseline research coordinator for the Iron Brotherhood. I brought actual food."

Food. When's the last time I ate something that wasn't delivered? I shuffle to the door and peer through the peephole. Middle-aged woman in a sensible blazer, holding what appears to be a genuine home-cooked meal in a covered casserole dish.

She's also not trying to look impressive or intimidating, which automatically puts her ahead of every other recruiter who's shown up this week.

I open the door. "You said baseline?"

"Never Awakened," she confirms cheerfully. "Tried multiple times, never took. Turns out I'm much better at studying you people than being one of you."

I like her already.

"Dr. Walsh, right? I saw your research on portal formation patterns. The correlation between population density and manifestation rates?"

"You read academic papers on portal theory?" She looks genuinely surprised.

"I read everything when I'm procrastinating. Which is most of the time." I step aside to let her in. "Sorry about the mess. This whole recruitment thing is..."

"Overwhelming?" She sets the casserole dish on my kitchen counter, moving aside a brochure for something called "Death's Head Delvers" to make room. "That's completely normal. Most new Awakened get about fifty recruitment offers in the first week."

"Fifty?" I gesture at the paper explosion that used to be my living room. "I count maybe twenty."

"Oh, honey." Dr. Walsh looks sympathetic. "You stopped a portal incursion single-handed and unlocked a rare specialist class on your first day. The serious recruiters haven't even started yet."

My stomach drops. "This gets worse?"

"Much worse. But that's why I'm here." She opens the casserole dish, revealing what smells like actual homemade lasagna. "To explain your options before the feeding frenzy really begins."

I find clean plates while she serves. Real food tastes like a revelation after three days of delivery pizza and recruiter stress.

"So," I say around a mouthful of perfectly seasoned pasta. "Iron Brotherhood. Military-style hierarchy, government contracts, reputation for discipline and effectiveness."

"You did your homework."

"I googled everyone. Your lawsuit history is impressive."

Dr. Walsh laughs. "We prefer 'legally proactive.' But yes, we've had our share of conflicts with other guilds. Occupational hazard when you're successful."

"What makes you different from Azure Company? They've got great benefits, publicly traded stock options, professional development programs..."

"Azure optimizes for profit margins and public relations. We optimize for member survival and mission success. Different priorities."

She pulls out a tablet and shows me a spreadsheet. "Casualty rates for delving operations, broken down by guild affiliation. Notice anything?"

I study the numbers. "Iron Brotherhood has the lowest injury rate despite taking higher-risk contracts."

"Because we train properly and we don't cut corners to improve quarterly earnings." Dr. Walsh sets the tablet aside. "Riley—can I call you Riley?—what do you want out of this?"

"Honestly? I have no idea." I push lasagna around my plate, thinking. "A week ago I was organizing birthday parties for coworkers who barely tolerate me. Now I've got magical powers and people keep telling me I'm special."

"And that scares you."

"Terrifies me. What if I'm not actually good at this? What if the coffee shop thing was just luck?"

"Want to know a secret?" Dr. Walsh leans forward conspiratorially. "Every successful Awakened I've studied started with exactly that fear. The ones who think they're naturally amazing? They tend to get themselves and their teammates killed."

That's... actually reassuring.

"The Iron Brotherhood approach," she continues, "is gradual development with extensive support systems. You'd start with basic training, advance at your own pace, work with experienced teams until you're ready for independence. No pressure to become a superstar overnight."

"What's the catch?"

"Five-year minimum commitment. We invest heavily in training, so we need time to see returns. Also, you'd be working with a lot of former military and law enforcement. They can be... intense."

I think about my last boss, who once held a thirty-minute meeting to discuss the proper format for email subject lines. "I can handle intense."

My doorbell rings again. Dr. Walsh checks her watch. "That'll be Azure Company. Miranda Kim, if I'm not mistaken. She's good at her job."

"How do you—never mind. Should I talk to her?"

"Absolutely. You should talk to everyone before deciding. Just remember that whatever they offer you, the real question is whether they'll help you become the person you want to be."

She packs up the leftover lasagna—"for later"—and heads for the door. "Think about what I said. And Riley? The coffee shop thing wasn't luck. You saw a problem, assessed the situation, and took effective action under pressure. That's exactly what Coordinators are supposed to do."

After she leaves, I answer the door for Ms. Kim from Azure Company. Perfectly styled hair, designer suit, smile that probably costs more than my monthly rent.

"Riley Martinez!" She sweeps into my apartment like she owns the place. "What an absolute pleasure to meet you. I'm Miranda Kim, Senior Talent Acquisition Specialist for Azure Company. I have such exciting opportunities to discuss!"

She hands me a business card that somehow feels expensive. Probably the paper quality.

"I've been following your case since the incident report hit the system," she continues, settling onto my couch without being invited. "Rare class unlock, exceptional tactical thinking, media-friendly demographics—you're exactly what Azure is looking for in our next generation of guild leaders."

"Media-friendly demographics?"

"Young, articulate, photogenic, relatable background. Our marketing team is very excited about your potential."

I'm not sure whether to be flattered or insulted. "I'm not looking to be a poster child."

"Of course not! But in today's environment, public perception matters. The Awakened community needs positive role models, and guilds that understand modern branding have significant advantages."

She opens a sleek presentation folder. "Let me show you what Azure can offer. Starting salary of $120,000 annually, full benefits including magical healing coverage, stock options that vest over four years, and immediate enrollment in our executive leadership development program."

I nearly choke on my water. "One hundred and twenty thousand?"

"Plus performance bonuses tied to successful mission completion. Our top Coordinators earn well into the mid-six figures within five years."

Holy shit. That's more than my parents make combined.

"What's the commitment?"

"Three-year renewable contract with advancement opportunities. Most of our people stay much longer because we offer the best career development in the industry."

She flips through glossy photos of Azure facilities. Modern office buildings, high-tech training centers, what appears to be a corporate cafeteria that puts most restaurants to shame.

"Our Seattle headquarters includes fully equipped simulation chambers, a world-class magical research division, and partnerships with major universities for continuing education. You could complete your MBA while working, all expenses paid."

I think about Dr. Walsh's casualty statistics. "What about safety? Injury rates, support for members who get hurt?"

"Azure maintains the highest safety standards in the industry. We have comprehensive insurance, immediate medical response for all field operations, and psychological support services for trauma recovery."

That sounds good, but she didn't actually answer the question about injury rates.

"Can I see actual numbers? Casualty statistics, mission success rates, that kind of thing?"

Miranda's smile flickers slightly. "That information is proprietary, but I can assure you that Azure prioritizes member welfare above all else."

Translation: the numbers don't look as good as the marketing materials.

"I'll need time to think about it," I tell her.

"Of course! But I should mention that this offer is time-sensitive. We're only looking to fill three Coordinator positions this quarter, and the compensation package I'm offering is based on current market conditions."

Ah, the classic high-pressure sales tactic. Create artificial scarcity to force quick decisions.

"How long do I have?"

"I'd love to have your answer by Friday. That gives you—" she checks her phone "—four days to consider everything."

After Miranda leaves, I sit in my quiet apartment surrounded by recruitment materials and try to process everything. $120,000 starting salary versus gradual development with survival focus. Marketing opportunities versus genuine skill building. Executive leadership track versus military-style training.

My phone buzzes with a text from an unknown number:

*"Hi Riley! This is Marcus Williams, Guardian with Iron Brotherhood. Dr. Walsh said you might want to talk to actual team members. Free for coffee tomorrow? I promise no recruitment pressure—just honest conversation about what the job is really like. -Tank"*

Tank. Apparently everyone gets nicknames in this business.

I text back: *"Coffee sounds good. But somewhere that hasn't been attacked by interdimensional spiders recently."*

His response comes immediately: *"LOL. I know a place. 10 AM at Grounded on Pine Street?"*

*"See you there."*

I spend the rest of the evening reading through contracts and trying to figure out which questions I should be asking. The Azure offer is tempting—more money than I've ever imagined, prestigious career track, actual professional development.

But Dr. Walsh's comment keeps echoing in my head: "The real question is whether they'll help you become the person you want to be."

Problem is, I'm not entirely sure who that person is yet.

I guess that's what tomorrow's coffee is for.
